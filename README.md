# Decision-making for the challenge

1. I've readed carefully all provided documentation and went through all the mockups to identify elements that are going to be affected by the "Dark mode" feature. Then looked for patterns to develop as reutilizable elements.

2. Started research about "Dark mode" best techniques for a ReactJS project, and simplest modals components to use.

3. Decided to use a custom css layout without frameworks or grids, as this project is simple, in terms amount of elements and variations.

4. For the porpose of this challenge I decided to skip using css pre-processors because with the use of css3 built-in variables is good enough.

5. Icons where converted at https://fontello.com/ to an icon-font to make it easier to use and update. Json config file is located at '/src/css/fonts/source'. Make use of this file for future updates.

## Responsive approach

1. I decided to use flexbox css techniques, to achieve easier element adaptations and distribution at the available space.

2. Minimal media-queries where used to expand external margins near the edge of mobile devices, and center titles for small devices.

3. Media queries breakpoints taken from https://devfacts.com/media-queries-breakpoints-2020/

## HTML & CSS development

1. Started base HTML5 layout
2. Created base CSS3 styles
3. Created CSS3 color variables from documentation
4. Organized css files in content related files
5. Tested the app in different browsers and emulated devices with Chrome DevTools
