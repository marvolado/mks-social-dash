# Decision-making for the challenge

1. Readed carefully all documentation provided and went through all the mockups to identify elements that are going to be affected by the "Dark mode" feature. Then looked for patterns to develop as reutilizable elements.

2. Start research about "Dark mode" best techniques for a ReactJS project, and simplest modals components to use.

3. Decided to use a custom css layout without frameworks or grids, as this project is simple in terms amount of elements and variations.

4. For the porpose of this challenge I decided to skip using css pre-processors because with the use of css3 built-in variables is good enough.

5. Icons where converted to an icon-font to make it easier to use and updte

## Responsive approach

1. I decided to use flexbox css techniques, to achieve easier element adaptation and distribution at the available space.

2. Minimal media-queries where used to expand external margins near the edge of mobile devices

### HTML & CSS development

1. Started base HTML5 layout
2. Created base CSS3 styles
3. Created CSS3 color variables from documentation
4. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
